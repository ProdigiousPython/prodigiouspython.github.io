    "The first question I had when I got to see code having `else` block after a `loop` **What the heck is else doing here?**, but later I got to know that else can be used after the loop. Well, what does it do? We just got to know about the use of `break` in the loops, right? If the loop explicitly exits by the keyword `break`, the `else` block **doesn't** gets executed, else `else` block gets executed. let's see an example."
