Welcome to Prodigious Python üêç

Idea of Prodigious Python is to be different from the traditional books. 

We wanted Prodigious Python to be:

* Fun üéâ
* Executable ü§ñ
* Publishable via static web pages and PDF ‚öôÔ∏è

# Development setup

First things first, We need to clone our repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ProdigiousPython/ProdigiousPython.git
```

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for the dependency mangement.

Let's install the packages required using the below command:

```shell
poetry install
```

To run the jupyter-lab:

```shell
poetry run jupyter-lab
```

To convert the notebooks to html

```shell
poetry run jb build .
```

To convert the notebooks to pdf

```shell
poetry run jb build --builder=pdfhtml .
```
The generated files would be present in `_build` folder.
